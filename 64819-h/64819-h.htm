<h2 class="nobreak">SERVICE BY THE EDUCATED NEGRO.</h2>
</div>


<p>When George William Curtis had received from Harvard
her greatest degree, he arose at the Alumni Dinner
and said, &#8220;In the old Italian story the nobleman turns out
of the hot street crowded with eager faces into the coolness
and silence of his palace. As he looks at the pictures
of the long line of ancestors he hears a voice,&mdash;or is it his
own heart beating?&mdash;which says to him <span class="gesperrt">noblesse oblige</span>.
The youngest scion of the oldest house is pledged by all
the virtues and honor of his ancestry to a life not unworthy
his lineage.... When I came here I was not a nobleman,
but to-day I have been ennobled. The youngest doctor of
the oldest school, I too, say with the Italian, <span class="gesperrt">noblesse
oblige</span>. I am pledged by all the honorable traditions of
the noble family into which I am this day adopted.&#8221;... You,
my friends, are ennobled by the diploma of a school, rich
in traditions of high endeavor and actual service. Shall
those traditions fail to enter your hearts, and to quicken
your energies, and to chasten your ambitions? This question
you are not now competent to answer, and you will not
be competent until you have lived your lives.</p>

<p>Your equipment for the business of life is not contemptible.
As workers you have some acquaintance with the natural
resources of our country, and the ways in which they
have been utilized in the production and distribution of
commodities through the perfecting of industrial organization
and the applying of science to work. More, importantly,
you possess in varying degrees a group of valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
industrial qualities,&mdash;that ambition without which work is
drudgery and enlargement of life unsought and unattainable;
that habit of earnest endeavor which, established by
continuous attention to Greek or Latin, mathematics or history,
may be utilized in the school room, or on the farm, or
in the court room; that habit of self-control which enables
men to sacrifice vagrant impulse to sober duty; that resourcefulness
which discovers better methods of getting work
done; that directing intelligence by which one man can
effectively organize for a given purpose, many materials and
many workers. In addition to the knowledge and the qualities
I have mentioned, most of you have a settled disposition
toward some form of self-support appropriate to an exceptional
training; while you know that some men must black
other men&#8217;s boots, you also know that a boot-black with a
high school diploma at home means waste&mdash;waste of time,
waste of money, waste of education. Moreover, you appreciate
the duties and value the privileges of citizenship in
a democracy, and most of you have on the whole a serious
intent to do what you reasonably can to promote the general
welfare. Such is your equipment as citizens. Finally,
as human beings, you are able to participate in the intellectual,
&aelig;sthetic, and moral interests of cultivated people.
How may you with such equipment be really useful under
the conditions of American life? That is our problem.</p>

<p>And right here let me say that nobody wishes you to
make a profession of uplifting your race. In the first
place, that&#8217;s a pretty big job; and in the second
place, your race is uplifted whenever one of you manages
well a truck farm, a grocery store, a school room, or a
bank. Charity begins at home; your chief business should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
be to uplift each himself. My present purpose, however,
is to consider mainly how such individual success may contribute
to the welfare of the many.</p>

<p>Let us consider, first of all, how you may be of direct
service by work in which the chief factor is personal influence
and by work in which the chief factor is directing intelligence.</p>

<p>Teaching is an art inseparable from the personality of
the teacher,&mdash;an art in which a mature person seeks by personal
influence to help immature persons build their
characters soundly. Teaching ability, to adapt the words
of Cardinal Newman, &#8220;is not a mere extrinsic or accidental
advantage which is ours to-day and another&#8217;s to-morrow,
which may be got up from a book and easily forgotten
again, which we can command or communicate at our pleasure,
which we can borrow for the occasion, carry about in
our hands and take into the market; it is an acquired illumination,
it is a habit, a personal possession and an inward
endowment.&#8221; The best way to become a good teacher is,
therefore, to become a good man or a good woman, and to
grow in power to interest and influence young people. Such
personality and power cannot be manufactured to order,
but are slowly developed by much reading and thinking and
doing and no little contact with wholesome people. In
Charles Francis Adams&#8217; pungent address, at Cambridge in
1883, he said, &#8220;In these days of repeating rifles, my alma
mater sent me and my classmates out into the strife
equipped with shields and swords and javelins. We were
to grapple with living questions through the medium
of the dead languages.&#8221; While thus sharply criticizing the
content of the curriculum, Mr. Adams would have been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
first to maintain that to breathe the atmosphere of a university
is an assured way of getting broadened culture, and that
this atmosphere is made largely by the teachers. Frederick
Douglass had no university degree, but he was certainly a
man of culture; his teachers were among the choicest
spirits of an aroused generation&mdash;Sumner and Garrison and
Wendell Phillips&mdash;and they gave him breadth and balance
and clear-sightedness. Charles Francis Adams was set upon
the highway of modern culture despite the curriculum;
Douglass received that grace which is of the spirit of
literature without the curriculum. Both men were deeply indebted
to noble teachers. The thing that makes one man
really different from another is not so much knowledge as
character; and the thing that makes one school different
from another is not so much curriculum and apparatus, as
teaching body. Algebra and trigonometry, Greek and
Latin, history and political economy, the student will forget;
but he will not forget a teacher gentle but earnest, of
disinterested scholarship and life-long devotion. The specific
teaching may be quite erased from the memory, but in the
heart will be left a deepening respect for the teacher.</p>

<p>Many of you are to become class-room teachers. Remember
that teaching ability is an inward endowment; remember
that a morally stunted man or a ribbon-loving
woman cannot be an effective teacher. The most searching
critic of character I ever knew was a barefoot boy whose
laughing eyes danced over the pages of the fourth reader;
an intuitive philosopher he! School boy opinion has, I doubt
not, many vagaries but on the whole its essential decisions
as to teachers are amazingly correct. Whether you teach
geography by the Oswego Method, is not greatly to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
point; whether you have won the confidence of your class&mdash;that
is the main issue; and that conquest is not made by the
sword of discipline but by the spirit of vigorous goodness.</p>

<p>Moreover the genuine teacher knows that his duty is
not bounded by the four walls of the class-room. He is
dealing with boys and girls to be sure, but he is dealing with
more&mdash;with social conditions. The life and work of the
community he must study quite as much as he must study
the child. Indeed, child and man are largely products of
social conditions. The educated teacher, by friendly visits
to homes and by cheerful work in churches and societies,
will seek to elevate community opinion and the standard of
life and work. A crowded unclean home in an undrained
street, is almost as much an object of concern to the educated
teacher as is a hopeless little dunce who can&#8217;t spell
&#8220;rabbit!&#8221; Let us ground child-study in community study.</p>

<p>This knowledge of the life and work of the community
will react upon the program of study. The educated
teacher, I have said, aims at raising somewhat the level of
life in the community. The program of study is an instrument
for that end. A school unresponsive to the needs of
actual life is a school preparing for Utopia. The universities
and the public schools of the Western States illustrate
what I mean: for example, the University of California has
recently introduced a course in irrigation. And here in the
East, Cornell teaches poultry raising. For an unscrubbed
population the school should emphasize cleanliness; for a
propertyless population, foresight and thrift. Let me
speak even more definitely. In this city of Washington, as
in other urban communities, the death rate of the Negro
population is exceedingly high. This excessive death rate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
is due to a variety of causes; relatively low economic position
is a powerful cause. Thus, one of the largest industrial
insurance companies in the United States finds, I learn,
that the death rate of Negroes is practically the same as
that of whites, in approximately the same industrial
occupations; and there is much more evidence to the same
effect. In addition to the teaching of hygiene, the school
may aim to remedy the conditions expressed in the high
death rate, in two ways,&mdash;first, through imparting productive
capacity by the training of hands; and second, through
developing wants by the touching of hearts and arousing of
minds.</p>

<p>Already you have a manual training high school and
through the grades certain work in carpentry and sewing
and cooking. The increasing efficiency of all such work
should be welcomed and actively aided by every educated
teacher. After a while, let us hope, the schools here will
offer from one end to the other, such teaching of the industrial
arts as will prepare students worthily to maintain
themselves under severe economic stress. Do you realize
that, despite the enlargement of educational opportunities
in Washington and the growth of the Negro population,
there are probably here to-day fewer Negro artisans than
there were in 1870? Here is a profound need, and for the
schools a rare opportunity. Moreover, the school life of
most children is short, not over five or six years. If the
school possessed adequate facilities for giving industrial capacity,
more parents would be willing and able to let their
children remain in school seven and eight and nine years.
The schools and the cultivated portion of this community
cannot afford to give those who ask for bread a stone. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
must send the whole boy to school and not merely his head!</p>

<p>Not for a moment do I decry that important function
of the schools, which I have called the development of
wants. Human wants are social forces. Corn and cotton
are grown to supply certain bodily wants; the fine arts are
cultivated in response to certain &aelig;sthetic wants; philosophy
and pure science are elaborated at the quiet insistence of
certain intellectual wants; religion is preached to assuage
certain spiritual wants. Every voluntary act is the hand-maid
of some want. Now, it is the fundamental business
of the schools to enlarge the range of the students&#8217; interests
and wants, to stir up a divine discontent. The saddest
thing about the Negro peasant in his windowless cabin in
Georgia, the saddest thing about the Negroes in the filthy
shanties of Mobile, New York, and Washington, is not so
much poverty, as slovenly unconcern. What all such people
need&mdash;be they white or black, red or yellow&mdash;is the development
of wants&mdash;wants for better things. A man of
moderately developed wants will exert himself to get a
steady job under healthful conditions, to get a comfortable
house to live in&mdash;three or four sunny, pleasantly furnished
rooms and, if possible a garden for vegetables and flowers&mdash;yes,
he will exert himself to win a wife to make that house
a home. Such wants (and they are, you will note, not impossibly
spiritual) every school ought to tend to develop.</p>

<p>In short, the development of the wants of sober men
and the giving of the skill to buy the means of satisfying
those wants&mdash;these two things are vital to the work of the
school. Let me be clearly understood; the school should
of course develop the more spiritual wants, wants for the
things that give literature and art and religion their values.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
These spiritual things are the headwaters of the fullest and
deepest and highest enjoyments of life. But these matters
have long been emphasized in the traditions of school-men;
moreover, when the flesh is weak, the spirit is not very
strong. My wish just now is to emphasize the things that
lie at the basis of race maintenance and progress.</p>

<p>The considerations brought forward exhibit the opportunities
of the teacher and the high significance of the
teacher&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Teaching and preaching are very much alike. Phillips
Brooks said very truly that preaching is the bringing of truth
through personality. Some of you will prepare yourselves
to preach; all of you will have to do with preachers. There
is no lack of preachers but there is much lack of good
preachers. The preacher has the entree to the firesides of
the people. The educated preacher, like the educated
teacher, realizes the profound effect that the housing of the
working classes exerts upon the morals and the efficiency
and the happiness of the working classes, the profound effect
that surroundings exert upon life and character. The
preacher will use some of the influence that issues from his
superrational functions to make the homes of the people
hygienically as well as morally clean, to make those homes
more attractive than the resorts of vice.</p>

<p>Religion and the Church have, from a certain point of
view, two main functions,&mdash;first to make peace between
human society and assumed spiritual beings; and, second, to
antagonize anti-social acts and tendencies. The first function,
religion performs for a horde of man-eating savages as
well as for the congregation of St. Paul&#8217;s; the second function
religion performs, characteristically in a civilized society,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
by allying itself with morality. The surprisingly low death
rate of Jews wherever found is unquestionably due in
large part to this alliance of religion and morality. In our
English Bible we find:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And God spake all these words, saying,</p>

<p>&#8220;Honour thy father and thy mother....</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou shalt not kill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou shalt not steal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though shalt not covet thy neighbour&#8217;s house, thou
shalt not covet thy neighbour&#8217;s wife, ... nor anything that
is thy neighbour&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain
smoking.&#8221;...</p>

<p>Now, the practical usefulness of the preacher lies largely
in the fact that he supplies the sanctions for right doing,&mdash;the
thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the
trumpet, the mountain smoking, and in all but above all
Jehovah. To show the man in the street or in the cotton
field that for him lying and stealing are bad because, if everybody
were a liar and a thief, society would fall to pieces,&mdash;that
would be very well, but it would hardly make the man
honest in word and deed. If, however, you marshal feelings
of awe and reverence in defence of honesty, if you get
God on your side, your success is more assured and you
may develop a &#8220;sensibility to principle which feels a stain
like a wound.&#8221; The preacher fortifies the common moralities
with these religious sanctions and that is no easy business.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
The preacher must himself be righteous, resourceful,
sympathetic, with the gift of nearness to men. Such
qualities education is peculiarly fit to bestow or to develop,
and hence an educated ministry is sorely needed by our
people from Boston to New Orleans.</p>

<p>An educated ministry would realize that social settlements,
gymnasiums, kindergartens, day nurseries, friendly
visiting, homes for defectives and orphans and the aged
may fitly and usefully be organized and maintained by the
church. By such means the church may tend to establish
a kingdom of heaven on earth.</p>

<p>Among cultivated Negroes there is apparent an unfortunate
tendency to look at preachers askance. This is due
largely to reaction against bad preachers, and to failure to
understand and appreciate the temporal opportunities of
the Church. I argue for the usefulness of good preachers
and of the &#8220;institutional&#8221; church. Though no member of
this graduating class should become a preacher or a preacher&#8217;s
wife, every member may wisely ally himself with the
church and use his personal influence to enlarge and
strengthen church work, to make it definite and human and
nobly practical.</p>

<p>So much for the work in which personal influence is the
determining factor. Medicine and business are types of
the work in which what I have rudely called directing intelligence
determines.</p>

<p>In the profession of medicine, I admit, personal influence
and directing intelligence subtly interlace. The Negro
doctor&#8217;s social position makes him specially accessible
to Negroes in cases of need. As a friend of the family or
of the family&#8217;s friends, the doctor is not dreaded as a feelingless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
stranger with a terrible knife. Moreover, the Negro
doctor does not feel himself a man of alien blood come
to tend an inferior. Social position and understanding sympathy,
then, render the Negro doctor readily accessible and
very useful. Moreover, the Negro&#8217;s physical condition offers
the doctor large opportunities for noble service. In a
book upon &#8220;Ethnic Factors in the Population of Boston,&#8221;
Doctor Bushee says, &#8220;In Boston the mortality of the Negro
is much larger than that of any other ethnic factor&#8221;;
again, &#8220;A high death rate, instead of a low birthrate is
causing the Negroes to disappear&#8221;; and the statistics are not
much more encouraging in many other urban communities
North and South. That relatively low economic
position is a powerful factor in producing this alarming
death rate, I have already suggested; another capital
factor is pitiable ignorance of the rudiments of personal hygiene
and of sanitation. Negro doctors may without much
trouble diffuse throughout a community these rudiments of
knowledge and in so doing will prove themselves public
servants. North and South the conspicuous financial success
and substantial social service of hundreds of Negro
doctors eloquently establish the correctness of this view;
and of practising physicians, the Negro people to-day have
unmistakably too few.</p>

<p>What of the Negro business man? In Washington public
employment and the professions have captured most of
the energetic and alert Negroes, to the injury of business
development. Springfield, Massachusetts; Richmond, Virginia;
Dayton, Ohio,&mdash;not one of these important cities has
a total population as large as the Negro population of the
District of Columbia. As buyers of goods, eighty-seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
thousand people are important; but as sellers of goods, the
eighty-seven thousand Negroes in Washington are by
no means important. For example, of the total profits on
the dry goods bought in a year by the Negro population of
Washington,&mdash;profits amounting to thousands and thousands
of dollars, for the ratio of expenditure to income is
exceptionally large,&mdash;what per cent. goes to Negro merchants?
Shall I say five per cent., one per cent., or one thousandth
of one per cent.? Mathematical precision is, of course,
not possible but you and I know that practically none of
these profits go to Negro merchants. And you and I could
name a dozen white merchants who have been enriched by
those profits. And in consideration of this fact how many
Negro clerks have the white merchants placed in their stores?
how many Negro floor walkers? how many Negro buyers?
And, my friends, how many thousands of years must elapse
before the Washington Negro will add to his culture
enough co-operative endeavor and competitive power to
change all this? I myself have never yet been convinced
that the Anglo-Saxon and the Jew really need the black
man&#8217;s charity. Though I cannot point out, then, to the
members of this graduating class openings in established
business houses, I can point out that their success in business
will provide opportunities for some later class, and
will help to make the spending of Negroes enrich Negroes.
Let me suggest two other ways in which the Negro business
men may be of great service to the many. In the first
place, the rents charged Negroes in cities, for example,
Washington, are considerably higher for the same accommodations
than the rents charged white people. By offering
good houses at reasonable rents to the Negro working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
class, the Negro business man will find a paying investment
and a means of much service. In the second place, hotels,
restaurants, and theatres even in the capital of the nation
are open to black men and women only on degrading terms,
or not open at all. The closing of such accommodations is
really the opening for black business men of the doors of
opportunity.</p>

<p>In discussing ways of direct service I have then mentioned
teaching and preaching as types of the work in which
the decisive factor is personal influence. Medicine and business
I have mentioned as types of the work in which the
decisive factor is directing intelligence.</p>

<p>And now I wish to discuss two ways in which educated
Negroes may be of indirect service,&mdash;first, by offering their
fellows copies for imitation, and, second, by establishing
the dignity of the race. In 1881, hardly a white man or a
black man in the country dreamed that in twenty-two years
a Negro would have achieved the building of a beautiful
city in a Southern wilderness, would have organized efficiently
the business of that industrial community of some
1700 people, would have won the abiding confidence of
white men and black men North and South, would have
brought the white North and the white South into intelligent
co-operation in the uplifting of black men, would have
worked out a solution for the central problem in American
education, would have been acknowledged master of arts
by the oldest university in the land, would have written one
of the impressive books of the century, would have been
asked by the British Government for help in the reconstruction
of South Africa, would have been called by the sanest
of British critics of affairs the most notable figure in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
American Republic! And yet, this miracle you and I
see to-day with our own eyes. The example of this man is
being imitated in a hundred educational and industrial communities
in the Southern States. And all men feel more
respect for the Negro race because out of its loins has come
Booker T. Washington.</p>

<p>A constructive statesman like Washington, educators
like Lewis Moore and Lucy Moten and your own Anna
Cooper, theologians like Bowen and Grimke, scholars like
Blyden and Scarborough and DuBois and Kelly Miller, inventors
like Woods and McCoy, a novelist like Chesnutt, a
poet like Dunbar, a musician like Coleridge-Taylor, a
painter like Tanner&mdash;yes, and, of those who are gone,
Banneker who searched the heavens; Toussaint, soldier and
statesman; Aldridge, the tragedian with his first medal in
arts and sciences from the King of Prussia; Pushkin, the
poet of the Russias; Dumas, father and son; the saintly
Crummel; and Douglass the argument for freedom,&mdash;I
say, the indirect service of such people is incalculable.</p>

<p>Now, for you and me no such careers are probable and
yet every educated Negro who is worth his salt, is in similar
fashion a copy for imitation and serves to secure respect
for his race. The Negro contractor and builder; the Negro
who owns a well managed truck farm; the Negro school
teacher, who has saved money enough to buy municipal
bonds or shares in a railway,&mdash;that person becomes in a
money getting time a definite and concrete argument to
white men and to black men that black men can be more
than hewers of wood and drawers of water, than cooks and
coachmen. Fundamentally, you and I by our thoughtfulness,
our practical interest in the happiness of others, our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
elevation above petty prejudice, our simplicity, our decisive
prudence, our enduring energy, our devotion, may indirectly
count for good in a thousand ways in the life and
work of our communities.</p>

<p>And, now, my friends, you enter the circle of educated
men and women. Your personal influence will be felt in
school room and in pulpit. Your directing intelligence will
count in law, and medicine, and business; as able and devoted
men and women, you by your examples will steady
the nerves of a staggering people and make the word Negro
more than a reproach. Delicate indecision, hesitant
virtue, carping discontent, bric-a-brac culture&mdash;these ill become
stalwart men and robust women. By all the honorable
traditions of the noble family into which you are now
adopted, you are pledged not to pick your way daintily in
the soft places of the earth; you are pledged to make your
lives real, useful, constructive. Remember&mdash;<span class="gesperrt">noblesse

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
